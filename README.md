The Supply Chain Audit Trail DApp is a blockchain-based decentralized application that ensures transparency and traceability in the supply chain process. Built using Solidity, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

Key roles include Owner, Admin, and User, managed via a custom AccessControl system. Admins can add products and update their status, while users can track product history.

The application features wallet connection via MetaMask, role verification, product status management, and audit trail viewing that shows the complete history of updatesâ€”who made the changes, what was updated, and when.

This system provides a secure and immutable way to monitor product movements, fostering trust and accountability across the supply chain.
